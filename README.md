This repository is a projet for the  Master 1 Micro-Nano-Electronics.
The projet is about interfacing a screen to display usefull information, such as speed, power consumption, battery etc...
for an "eco-car" made for the "ecoshell marathon" wich takes place every years and challenges student all over the world to build efficient power cars.
